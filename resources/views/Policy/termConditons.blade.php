<h2>ARTICLE XVI
GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ATTORNEY’S FEES; JURY TRIAL</h2>
<p>
16.1. These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Florida without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE RELATIONSHIP RESULTING IN OR FROM THESE
TERMS OR BREACH OF ANY DUTIES HEREUNDER MUST BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) which may be found
at www.adr.org. All hearings will be held in Miami, Florida before an arbitrator who is a licensed attorney in
the state of Florida with at least fifteen (15) years of applicable experience. A judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in a Court with competent jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration
Act (Title 9 U.S. Code Section 1 et. seq.) shall govern all arbitration and confirmation proceedings. As a
condition precedent to the filing of an arbitration claim, the parties agree to first mediate any claims between
the parties hereto. Any party refusing to mediate shall not prevent the other party or parties from pursuing
their claims in arbitration. Nothing herein will be construed to prevent any party’s use of injunction, or any
other prejudgment or provisional action or remedy and any such action or remedy will not waive the moving
party’s right to compel arbitration of any dispute. The parties agree to also meet and negotiate in good faith
in order to resolve any disputes which may arise between them under these Terms. The parties agree that
the prevailing party shall not be responsible for any costs or fees associated with such arbitration, and that
the non-prevailing party shall pay all associated costs, including the reasonable attorney’s fees and legal
costs of the prevailing party.
<br><br>
16.2. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU AND COMPANY AGREE
THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PROGRAM MUST

<br><br>
16.3. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
ACTION OR LITIGATION IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR
USE OF THE PROGRAM.
